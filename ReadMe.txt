If you're reading this, hello! 

This is a sample of some of my saved assignments I've completed/worked-on during university; everything I've done isn't here, but this is hopefully sufficient to show nonetheless!

I tried to include a 'ReadMe' text file in each assignment as to explain their purpose and nature as well as any included documentation to make things easier to read through.

Thank you for your time!
